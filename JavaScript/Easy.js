// EASY: Create two variables and assign a person’s name to each. 
// Console log a statement that says which name is shorter or longer, and by how many characters.                                                       Example output: “The name Thomas is longer than John by 2 characters”


let person1 = "Nannette";
let person2 = "Iman";

if(person1 > person2){
    console.log(`${person1} is greater than ${person2}
    by 4 characters`)
}else(
    console.log(`${person2} is less than ${person1}
    `)
)
